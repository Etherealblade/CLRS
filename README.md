# CLRS

======================= CN ==================

CLRS的相关代码已经有2300多个repositories了, 但是很多结构都不太清晰, 不论是目录结构还是代码结构, 看起来不太友好. 
本repo的代码皆是在visual studio中完成, 双击 *.sln即可载入VS. 此外, 代码结构也比较清晰, 因为很多都是借鉴了geeksforgeeks.org, 比较适合入门.

======================= EN ==================

There are more than 2300 repositories on github, but lots of them are not friendly to novices due to their chaotic content and code structure.
Codes of this repo are all written in Visual Studio, they can be run by double clicking the respective .sln file. Besides, codes are relatively clear since I learned and simulated the style of geeksforgeeks.org so that they are suitable for novices.
